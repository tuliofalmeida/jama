This section contains information for building JAMA

# Hardware

This section covers how to build the proposed hardware.

## Materials:
- [ESP32-DevKit-C](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)
- GY-80
  - [L3G4200D](http://www.robotpark.com/image/data/PRO/91459/CD00265057.pdf)
  - [ADXL345](http://www.robotpark.com/image/data/PRO/91459/ADXL345.pdf)

### 3D printed case

The proposed circuit was built in a [3D Case](https://github.com/tuliofalmeida/jama/tree/main/3D%20case) available openly. The file has 2 models, the model shown on the right of the image was designed to be used with small 3.7 V batteries and the other for large batteries. The holes were not made in the model in order to make it easy to adapt (sensor, battery or ESP model), for use in this project the holes can be made by hand.

## Circuit

For the construction of the circuit, the connections must be made as shown in the image, by wiring or using jumpers.

Conections:
 - Battery (+) -> Swtich Button (+)
 - Switch Button (+) -> ESP32 VIN
 - Battery (-) -> ESP32 GND
 - ESP32 3.3V -> GY-80 VCC_3.3V
 - ESP32 GND -> GY-80 GND
 - ESP32 GPIO 21 -> GY-80 SDA
 - ESP32 GPIO 22 -> GY-80 SCL

# Firmware

This section discusses how to build the firmware on ESP32.

Softwares:
 - [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [PlatformIO](#Using-PlatformIO)

## Arduino on ESP32

This project brings support for the ESP32 chip to the Arduino environment. It lets you write sketches, using familiar Arduino functions and libraries, and run them directly on ESP32, with no external microcontroller required. Here we are using I2C and Async-TCP communications.

## Using VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

## Using PlatformIO

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) is an open source ecosystem for IoT
development with a cross-platform build system, a library manager, and full support
for Espressif (ESP8266) development. It works on the following popular host operating systems: macOS, Windows,
Linux 32/64, and Linux ARM (like Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, CubieBoard).

- [What is PlatformIO?](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/what-is-platformio.html)
- [PlatformIO IDE](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/espressif32/arduino_debugging_unit_testing.html)
  Cloud9, Codeanywhere, Eclipse Che (Codenvy), Atom, CLion, Eclipse, Emacs, NetBeans, Qt Creator, Sublime Text, VIM, Visual Studio, and VSCode

- [Installing on VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)

## Building on ESP32

### Code

Using PlatformIO within the VSCode, add the workspace to the JAMA firmware folder. To work, you must change the IP address in the main file to the IP that you want ESP32 to have, and edit the file "WiFistaTCP_h" and determine the IP and password of the Wi-Fi to be connected.

### Build

To build select PlatformIO with ESP32 connected to the computer and select "Upload and monitor".

### Test

Step by step:
- Make sure that the ESP32 is connected to power (battery or serial) and to the GY-80 sensor (if it is another sensor, you must change the library)
- Create a Wi-Fi Hotspot on your computer
- Make sure the machine's IP and password are correct.
- Turn on the ESP32

# Contributing

For minor fixes of code and documentation, please go ahead and submit a pull request.  A gentle introduction to the process can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-simple-git-guide-and-cheat-sheet-for-open-source-contributors/).

Check out the list of issues that are easy to fix. Working on them is a great way to move the project forward.

Larger changes (rewriting parts of existing code from scratch, adding new functions to the core, adding new libraries) should generally be discussed by opening an issue first. PRs with such changes require testing and approval.

Feature branches with lots of small commits (especially titled "oops", "fix typo", "forgot to add file", etc.) should be squashed before opening a pull request. At the same time, please refrain from putting multiple unrelated changes into a single pull request.
